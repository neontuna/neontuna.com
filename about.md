Hello there, you've somehow stumbled across my website.  First of all, I apologize
if the domain name is misleading.  Nightiron.com was available and sounded really cool,
like a hair metal band.  There's really nothing on here about night time or
metals.  However you will find posts about programming, computers, BBQ, cats, and programming
computers.  

...

Whoa, you're still here... Well my name is Justin Mullis.  I'm a native son of 
Charlotte, North Carolina.  There are exactly three people living in Charlotte that were born here.
I built my first computer when I was in highschool.

*Does your computer have a "Turbo" button?*

I continued tinkering, including a brief stint running a colo hosted web server
for friends and some small businesses.  In 2008 I started work as an IT guy for [F1-Networks][f1]
and I've been there ever since.  I love BBQ (NC BBQ, the only kind that matters), camping, 
screen prints, air plants, my awesome girlfriend Leah, and my giant cat Dixie.

Currently I'm cramming my brain with all things web development through the 
[Viking Code School][viking].

If you'd like to contact me, just say my name three times and I will appear.  Failing that, use the [contact page](/contact).
Or send me an [awesome tweet](https://twitter.com/nonadmn).
Thank you for reading!
