Hi, I'm Justin, welcome to my website.  

![Check out this nerd]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/551793_10150991698719185_1788344000_n.jpg)

*Here I am with my first computer, it had several megabytes of ram.*

Some professional background - As you can see, I am a super cool dude. For a while I ran a collocated web server, providing hosting and email services, while designing websites for local businesses.  In 2008, I started work as an IT guy for [F1-Networks][f1].  Eleven years later (when it became apparent that Windows was never going away) I switched things up and started programming for a local startup, [Rabbu][rabbu].  Now I have a Macbook with several hip stickers and instead of hating Microsoft I hate REST APIs.

If you'd like to contact me, just say my name three times and I will appear.  Failing that, use the [contact page](/contact). Or send a [hilarious tweet](https://twitter.com/neontunafishy).
Thank you for reading!
