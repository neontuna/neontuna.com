Hello there, you've stumbled across my website.  Oh, I mean Justin's website.  Its customary to write about yourself in third person, as if I have some assistant responsible for my blog.

*Justin's first computer, that he built, no big deal*

As you can see, Justin is a super cool dude. For a while he ran a collocated web server, providing hosting and email services.  In 2008, After spending more time blocking spammers and defending the server than actually developing, Justin started work as an IT guy for [F1-Networks][f1]. He's been there (and working from his home office) ever since. 

If you'd like to contact Justin, just say his name three times and he will appear.  Failing that, use the [contact page](/contact). Or send a [hilarious tweet](https://twitter.com/nonadmn).
Thank you for reading!
