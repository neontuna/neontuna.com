Last night I sat for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam, and thankfully passed.  I wanted to write a little about this as I think these certifications have a unique value during the pandemic - you can go through the entire process online.

Back in November, [udemy.com][1] ran a Cyber Monday sale that featured a ton of courses with huge discounts.  The [AWS Solutions Architect course from A Cloud Guru][2] was only $15.  A few friends were talking about taking the course and certification, it is the most popular certification for AWS.  I've been using AWS for a while but only for [small projects][9] and mostly I would just plow through the documentation for whatever service I was interested in.  At [Rabbu][4] we had a use case for putting together something using [Lambda][10] and where we had trouble was integrating the various AWS services together.  I figured the Solutions Architect course would at least be a good formal education on AWS and maybe could help with our project.

In hindsight I should have done a little more research.  While I'm definitely happy I went through with the course, and I know *a lot* more about AWS, the Solutions Architect is geared towards... someone architecting business solutions on AWS (surprise!).  This involves understanding the various AWS services that help a business migrate to the cloud as well as keeping applications running, highly available, and performant.  Beyond the Lambda project I really wanted to understand AWS more from a developer's perspective (services like [Elastic Beanstalk][11] and [DynamoDB][12]).

If I were starting now, I would have gone with AWS Certified Developer.  Which I have bought from [A Cloud Guru on udemy.com][5] as its on sale at the moment.  I have to admit I actually enjoying learning about and getting these certifications.  I think its seen as a chore for a lot of folks.

The A Cloud Guru course is pretty decent with about 12 hours of videos, quizzes, and a few practice exams.  I didn't realize that right around the time I was finishing the course, AWS updated the exam.  I could have taken the older version of the test but after some digging around to figure out what was updated (the [acloud.guru site][6] shows which content was changed recently) I decided to take the new exam.  I was a little disappointed that while the ACG course definitely covered all the bases, it was a little too high level.  In order to actually pass it was necessary to spend a lot of time reading the various service FAQs from AWS as well as purchase some additional practice tests.  The ACG instructor mentions using additional study material a few times during the course but its really sold (in my opinion) as a one stop shop for exam prep.  I opted for [this set][7] of additional practice tests from Digital Cloud Training, which includes cheat sheets that were really useful for some of the trivia type questions like whats the default timeout for x service option y.
   
Finally - the reason I think this is more relevant right now.  I was surprised that the exam itself had an option to be taken online.  Normally you would go to a testing center where you will be monitored during the exam.  [Pearson Vue][8] has an app you download to take the exam at home.  I'm a little afraid of going into the details as I don't want to violate any policies around the test but it was a pretty easy process.   

I'd highly recommend anyone with an interest in AWS, or any certification, check and see if you have the option for online proctoring.  We unfortunately may have a lot of free time to occupy. ðŸ˜·
