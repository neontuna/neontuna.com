        <title>Precious Gems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past month with Viking has been pretty interesting.  After getting through
the basic syntax of Ruby we went even deeper into object orientation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mastermind&quot;&gt;Mastermind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up with recreating the classic board game &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)&quot;&gt;Mastermind&lt;/a&gt;.  The main point of the exercise was to drive home the ideas behind method decomposition, classes, and other basic principles of OOP.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I had the most fun getting Mastermind to break my codes using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth&quot;&gt;Donald Knuth’s&lt;/a&gt; algorithm.  Properly optimized the software can break a code in
five guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the software first makes a list of every possible code (in regular Mastermind that’s 1296 codes).  It then makes a pretty standard first guess.  Like &lt;span class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green green&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real magic of the method didn’t make sense to me for a while.  The software gets feedback on its first guess, like say one spot is exactly correct (black peg) and one is the correct color but in the wrong position (white peg).  The software runs through the list of all 1296 possible codes, eliminating any that wouldn’t at least get that feedback.   Then it makes another guess and another elimination pass.  And so on, until it cracks the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_guess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_feedback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@last_guess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@last_guess&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@possibles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keep_if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@guesses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@last_guess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;optimal_guess&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;optimal_guess&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@possibles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@possibles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is my code for this.  And here we see the software cracking a code I set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/mastermind.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Mastermind code being cracked&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is even now only a few weeks later, I’m thinking “man, that code works but its confusing as hell to read”.  I’ve since learned to stop trying to do so much with every single line of code, lest it just look like a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tdd-minesweeper&quot;&gt;TDD Minesweeper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next unit &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-02%20at%201.52.25%20PM_large.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jeff Lebowski&#39;s &amp;quot;Danebook&amp;quot; page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been about a month since I was accepted into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vikingcodeschool.com&quot;&gt;Viking Code School&lt;/a&gt; and a few weeks since I began my coursework for their Flex program (for folks who can’t commit to the school full time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the experience so far can be summed up as “Whoa!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t doubt that there are hordes of self-made master programmers, I was getting discouraged by the lack of depth of a lot of the online programming courses I tried.  Their efforts were summed up very well by Erik Trautman’s blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard&quot;&gt;Why Learning To Code Is So Damn Hard&lt;/a&gt;.  Each of these courses holds your hand with bite size projects, slick videos, and really polished marketing and branding.  But coming out on the other side of their curriculum you are not a developer.  At best you might be able to have a conversation with a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more in-depth work, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railstutorial.org/&quot;&gt;Michael Hartl’s Rails’ Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t enough for me (and Rails’ Tutorial is seriously awesome).  Viking’s freely available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep&quot;&gt;“Prep” courses&lt;/a&gt; are what made me realize that I was basically never going to learn anything about development by only &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; videos and typing out lines of code from a book.  In order to learn I need to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Viking, while there is plenty of reading, demonstration videos, and tests there are also truly open ended projects.  The screenshot above is from “Danebook”.  After learning HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and Bootstrap you’re given a few mockups of the site and that’s it.  Everything else you code up from nothing.  Finishing one of those projects gives so much more of a feeling of accomplishment than getting to the end of any simple tutorial where you might have typed a few dozen lines of code at the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve just put the finishing touches on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nonadmin/assignment_toh&quot;&gt;Towers of Hanoi&lt;/a&gt; game from the first Ruby unit.  And I can’t wait for more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Monitoring DirectAccess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently deployed &lt;a href=&quot;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn636118.aspx&quot;&gt;Windows DirectAccess&lt;/a&gt; for one of our clients and wanted to monitor the deployment.  In particular I was interested in the number of active DirectAccess sessions and if any errors were detected.  The Remote Access MMC snap-in (in Server 2012 R2) has a great  status page that runs down all of DirectAccess’ components and reports any errors that are detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-17%20at%203.17.44%20PM_large.png&quot; alt=&quot;DirectAccess built-in monitoring&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can basically assume that if any of these are red you’re going to have an issue.  With PRTG the number of components in an error state could be a channel in a sensor which we could monitor and report on (for instance if the number of errors is greater than 0).   Similarly another channel could be the number of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DirectAccess comes loaded with a few PowerShell cmdlets for monitoring and reporting on its status.  In particular &lt;strong&gt;Get-RemoteAccessHealth&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Get-RemoteAccessConnectionStatisticsSummary&lt;/strong&gt; will give you a lot of information.  In order to make that data useful for PRTG we want to strip that output down from something like this (the raw output of Get-RemoteAccessHealth)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Component            RemoteAccessServer   HealthState     TimeStamp            Id              OperationStatus

&lt;p&gt;To literally just the number of components with a HealthState of “error”.  This gives us our first sensor channel, “error count”.   Our second channel is similar, I just want know how many active DirectAccess sessions we have which involves stripping down the output of Get-RemoteAccessConnectionStatisticsSummary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;TotalConnections           : 8
TotalDAConnections         : 8
TotalVpnConnections        : 0
TotalUniqueUsers           :
MaxConcurrentConnections   : 19
TotalCumulativeConnections : 2550
TotalBytesIn               : 4024483872
TotalBytesOut              : 8136960808
TotalBytesInOut            : 12161444680&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To just the number of TotalDAConnections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full PowerShell script is below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot; data-lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;?xml version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;`&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;`&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; encoding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;`&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Windows-1252&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;`&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; ?&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;prtg&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Try&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;result&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;DirectAccess Errors&amp;lt;/channel&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;$daErrorCount&amp;lt;/value&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/result&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;result&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;DirectAccess Sessions&amp;lt;/channel&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;$daUserCount&amp;lt;/value&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/result&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;[system.exception]&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;error&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/error&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;text&amp;gt;$_&amp;lt;/text&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/prtg&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a PRTG sensor with the following channel setup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-17%20at%2010.50.01%20PM_large.png&quot; alt=&quot;Silvrback blog image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key lines here that give PRTG its value for the channels are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;(Get-RemoteAccessHealth -ComputerName SERVER | Where-Object {$_.HealthState -match &amp;#39;Error&amp;#39;} | measure).count&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Get-RemoteAccessConnectionStatisticsSummary -ComputerName SERVER | Select -ExpandProperty TotalDAConnections&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is getting our error count.  As we move down the command we’re filtering the output of Get-RemoteAccessHealth for the HealthState column and then looking for any matches on the value “Error”.  Both measure and count are needed to just return in integer, measure by itself returns this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Count    : 0
Average  :
Sum      :
Maximum  :
Minimum  :
Property :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get-RemoteAccessHealth is returning a table and PowerShell makes it pretty easy to search through it like you might search for something in Excel.  Get-RemoteAccessConnectionStatisticsSummary is a little trickier.   Its returning a list and if you try to use the same method of stripping its output as Get-RemoteAccessHealth that won’t work.  However Select -ExpandProperty will.  This took me a while to figure out until I piped the output of each command through Get-Member which reveals the Object-Types being returned.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://windowsitpro.com/powershell/powershell-basics-formatting&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was very helpful during that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the script is pretty standard fare for PRTG’s custom XML sensors (a lot of great examples can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/prtg-addons/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FCustom_EXE_Sensors%2FWindows_Powershell&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  The entire script is returning back to PRTG something that looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=`&amp;quot;1.0`&amp;quot; encoding=`&amp;quot;Windows-1252`&amp;quot; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;prtg&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;result&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;DirectAccess Errors&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/channel&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/value&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/result&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;result&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;DirectAccess Sessions&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/channel&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;10&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/value&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/result&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/prtg&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is just the XML formatting that PRTG needs to construct a sensor.  The try statement is used to catch any errors since PowerShell can be annoying to get setup for remote monitoring and I wanted to make sure that any issues with the sensor itself were handled by PRTG instead of the sensor silently failing (for instance returning 0 for a channel, which wouldn’t necessarily set off any alarms but might happen if one of our cmdlets failed)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Straddling OSX and Windows</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to stock photo sites in order to use an Apple product you must obsessively arrange your desk into perfect geometric patterns, like a serial killer.  I have not done this yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_1434_large.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;my messy desk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while now I’ve been interested in web development.  I’ll run through a tutorial here and there - &lt;a href=&quot;http://railstutorial.org&quot;&gt;railstutorial.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnpythonthehardway.org&quot;&gt;learn python the hard way&lt;/a&gt; have been my favorites (yes I realize these are two different languages, I have commitment issues).  If you’re primarily using Windows modern web development can be frustrating to learn.  Every tutorial starts out instructing you to use an OSX package manager and generally include some huge caveat for getting your development environment configured in Windows.  I had no desire to learn Microsoft’s languages, such as ASP.NET, so I decided I should look into a Macbook.  Also that my Dell notebook has always been kind of a piece of junk and that I don’t particularly like Windows 8/8.1 helped push me towards “switching”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now typing this from my Macbook Pro and Thunderbolt display.  I haven’t fully made the switch for my day job as a remote IT worker.  I’m still trying to suss out how I want my browsers setup, which softphone to use, and some other odds and ends.  Funny thing is, there isn’t much I need Windows for in order to support our clients that mostly run Windows.  I will probably always keep around a Windows system (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nonadmin.com/home-server&quot;&gt;or 12&lt;/a&gt;) because other IT people don’t respect you if you only have one computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is sort of a compilation of things I’ve noticed and some tips for anyone coming from the Windows world.    I’ve arranged things with buying tips first and then good, bad, and miscellaneous observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;buying-tips&quot;&gt;Buying Tips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the notebook I researched and bought a few things from Amazon. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1D3fmGd&quot;&gt;mStand laptop stand&lt;/a&gt; which is way overpriced for a piece of bent aluminum but I guess it holds the notebook at eye level adequately.  I also picked up an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1wYwpJ5&quot;&gt;ethernet adapter/usb hub&lt;/a&gt; from Anker which instantly became useful because I didn’t have the display (with its NIC) initially.  I really like Anker’s products, they’re generally pretty inexpensive but well built.  I also grabbed an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1HXbO9r&quot;&gt;Incase Neoprene Sleeve&lt;/a&gt; that is apparently made for the 13” MacBook Pro but has a little too much extra space in it. I feel like it ought to fit the notebook snugly and not allow it to move at all inside the sleeve.  Finally, I purchased the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCKYA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Thunderbolt Display&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon as well.  I was going to purchase a Magsafe&amp;gt;Magsafe 2 power adapter as the Thunderbolt display’s charging cable isn’t compatible with the latest Macbooks but then I found out that these are now being included with the displays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the notebook itself I found a really handy &lt;a href=&quot;http://appleinsider.com/mac_price_guide&quot;&gt;price guide&lt;/a&gt; from Apple Insider and ended up picking up the system from Adorama with 3 years of AppleCare bundled.   They threw in an Apple TV with the promo code from Apple Insider but checking the guide now that has changed to a mighty mouse.  I also checked the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/&quot;&gt;Buyer’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; from Mac Rumors, just incase a new model was about to drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I was not going to buy the Thunderbolt display but one issue with living in Apple’s world is you have to play by their rules.  There is no official dock for the Macbook, the Thunderbolt Display is the closest thing to it.  My other options were Thunderbolt hubs which are several hundred dollars and may or may not have worked with my existing monitor which uses DVI-D.  So I reluctantly decided to get the Thunderbolt display but I feel like Apple could make a lot of people happy if they’d just release a dock.   I use a simple KVM to switch keyboard and mouse between the notebook and my PC tower, which is exclusively connected to my old display.  I thought I would need an Apple keyboard but really its no big deal.  The keys are in the same position except with the Windows key acting as the Command key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I occasionally listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macpowerusers.com/&quot;&gt;Mac Power Users podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which was kind of funny to do before I actually owned an Apple computer.  But from it I gleaned a lot of information on OSX applications I’d want to pick up.  So far &lt;a href=&quot;http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html&quot;&gt;TextExpander &lt;/a&gt;has been my favorite.  If you’re not familiar with text expansion, you basically type a shortcut and the application automatically fills in something for you.  For instance if I type &lt;code&gt;;gm&lt;/code&gt; I get my email address.    It seems like I type my email address about 30 thousand times a day so I love having that.  I’ve also started using the advanced features (known as macros) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/44456425&quot;&gt;quickly fill out&lt;/a&gt; some reminder emails I send frequently that are always the same text.  I was already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; user and its definitely been my favorite password manager.  It is expensive to get the bundle for Windows, OSX, and iOS but really worth it considering how much information I store in the app and how much &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nonadmin.com/password-insecurity&quot;&gt;more secure&lt;/a&gt; it makes my online life.  1password might be the prettiest piece of software I use, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter (damn it).  I still have some other applications I’d like to check out, namely Hazel and Omnifocus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Macbook’s trackpad and keyboard are the best I’ve used on a notebook, period.  Trackpads on PC notebooks have long been a point of contention.  Whether they’re too small, have weird gestures, or just plan don’t work there’s always some issue.  The latest EliteBooks from HP have come the closest to getting it right that I’ve seen.  Battery life on the notebook has been great and I love that OSX will tell you which apps are eating a lot of energy.  Coming from a system that mysteriously always ran awful on battery this has been most excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/osx/continuity/&quot;&gt;continuity features&lt;/a&gt; of Yosemite were a big reason I was interested in switching.  I already own an iPhone and iPad.  Being able to iMessage, and even send regular text, from the computer is very convenient.    This is where I feel like Apple is really edging out Microsoft, it would give people a reason to actually consider Windows Phone to have this sort of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Macbook has only locked up twice but both were kind of worrying.  The first  was actually right out of the box during setup.  It hung forever when I declined to setup iCloud Drive.  When I forced the system to reboot it went  through but had apparently already created my user account.  I elected to just wipe the system out and start over using the download from internet option to install Yosemite.  This worked without issue.  The system also froze completely when I first connected it to the Thunderbolt Display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost immediately discovered an unfortunate bug with Exchange Online and Yosemite.  The Contacts App will not sync contacts from an Office 365 Exchange Online account (or at least from my account).  An issue &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/resolving-contacts-sync-on-os-x-error-soapwebserviceserrordomain&quot;&gt;documented by others&lt;/a&gt; but remains unfixed even in the latest Yosemite beta (currently 10.10.2).  I opened a case with Microsoft support, who promptly laughed and then closed the case.  I haven’t tried opening one with Apple just yet.  I worked around the problem by manually copying my contacts into iCloud.  There’s a sort of hack to use Microsoft’s OWA app in iOS to sync your contacts into iCloud but this only works on the default/base Contacts folder and I maintain more than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-miscellaneous&quot;&gt;The Miscellaneous&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I notice the most is that I’ve gotten a feel for performance on a PC.  You get a sixth sense for if something isn’t right.  Like if Outlook takes longer than 30 seconds to open its probably not going to open at all.  I feel a little lost sometimes on the Mac if something unexpected happens and I find myself starring at the beachball.  I also really miss indicator lights for disk activity, etc, and find myself tapping the caps lock key to make sure my Macbook is alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are way more boot options for the Mac than Windows and I sort of wish they were all consolidated into one menu.  Although not having the POST and then Windows load that I’m used to is what makes for the variety of options/confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately loaded Bootcamp on the system but I haven’t really had much reason to use it.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion&quot;&gt;VMWare Fusion&lt;/a&gt; can use your Bootcamp partition as a virtual machine to run Windows apps within OSX, this is good because you don’t need to devote any more disk space to another virtual hard drive.  Initially I thought I would probably use Fusion to run Outlook 2013 instead of the latest Outlook for Mac but then I discovered that Fusion takes a good chunk of battery and really the latest Outlook for Mac is good enough. I’d still like it to have more feature parity with the Windows version and to stop using Exchange Web Services (Windows connects to Exchange using MAPI).  At work I’ve been going back and forth with Microsoft for months to try to figure out why the latest Outlook for Mac will not send attachments larger than 10 or so MB when using an Exchange 2010 account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far Apple has lived up to its promise to “just work” in every way except for the Contacts bug.  I hope to update this post and add others with more good things as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Godaddy sucks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week the HTTP monitoring sensors for one of our clients started going haywire.  Their site was taking way too long to load or not loading at all.  Going to the site in a web browser presented alternating database errors and partial loads of the content.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our clients are hosted through Godaddy and were originally setup years ago.  If we were making that decision again it’d probably be with a different company.  But the cost of moving clients off Godaddy pretty much outweighs our personal feelings about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called Godaddy support about the site.  For hosting support you end up speaking with a first level phone rep and if you’re escalated it just means that same phone rep talks to someone at a higher level for you.  So after deflecting her initial assertion that our Wordpress was configured incorrectly she escalated the call.  Second level apparently told her that we should enable SSH access to our account which would migrate everything to a different datacenter.  I protested this, we didn’t need SSH access and this seemed like a really hack method of resolving issues.  She continued to insist this was the only option and so I went ahead with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later and the site was loading fine.  The rep had said that some updates would need to be made to the Wordpress configuration to point to the new database location but we never received the email that was supposed to detail these changes.  So I logged into our client’s hosting panel and was presented with a page that stated we didn’t have a hosting plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called Godaddy again.  The phone rep reported that the site never migrated completely.  The content is on the new server while the database is still on the old system.  Godaddy’s solution to this?  Remove the (Wordpress) database, which will bring the site down, but will allow the migration to complete.  And then restore the database on the new system.  Total downtime?  1-3 &lt;strong&gt;Days&lt;/strong&gt;.  We still have access to the data and old database, and so my suggestion was that a new hosting account be created and we simply upload everything and restore a database backup.  Godaddy says this will work but we’ll need to purchase the hosting plan.  And we’ll need to do all the migration legwork ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically Godaddy support tells me to do something which breaks our hosting plan and then tells me to take the site down to fix it, or migrate to a new hosting plan on our dime to fix things without any downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Randomizing new Plex pre-roll feature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vlcsnap-2014-08-14-00h28m55s45_large.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simpsons THX Preroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the wonderful folks at Plex announced support for extras and trailers to play before you watch a movie.  Which was already pretty great, but then a few days ago they &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.plex.tv/2014/08/11/new-trailers-features/&quot;&gt;added support&lt;/a&gt; for a custom “pre-roll” to play after the trailers and before your movie.  This immediately made me think of all the awesome stuff that used to play in movie theatres and on home video - THX, creepy lobby snack commercials, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the feature requires that you set one video from your library as the pre-roll clip.  I wanted to randomize this so the clip would change occationally.  Luckily the setting is stored in the registry (by the way this is for folks using Windows as their Plex server) under this key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Plex, Inc.\Plex Media Server\CinemaTrailersPrerollID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for instance, the full registry key for one of my clips looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Plex, Inc.\Plex Media Server]
&quot;CinemaTrailersPrerollID&quot;=&quot;http://plex.tv/web/app#!/server/2b6b5...
...099e7fcbd0/details/%2Flibrary%2Fmetadata%2F4655&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s probably a million ways to do this but I created a .reg file for each pre-roll in my collection and then used this VBScript to randomly insert the registry value for one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vbnet&quot; data-lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Dim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;intOption&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Wscript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CreateObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Wscript.Shell&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Randomize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;intOption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;intOption&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;regedit /S C:\etc\pre-roll-1.reg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;regedit /S C:\etc\pre-roll-2.reg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;regedit /S C:\etc\pre-roll-3.reg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;regedit /S C:\etc\pre-roll-4.reg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;regedit /S C:\etc\pre-roll-5.reg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;End&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WshShell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I set that to run on a schedule every hour.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine we’ll have the option to do something like this from Plex itself before too long.  On the blog linked above there were already a few requests for it.  Regardless, these new features are slick and I hope convince more folks to sign up for Plex pass. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Need data from a dead Surface Pro?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/photo_large.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;The innards of a dead Surface tablet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a client that went all in with the first generation Surface Pro, many of their staff are using the tablets as their daily driver and only computer.  Earlier this afternoon I responded to what is usually a typical situation for IT professionals - dead computer, we need data on the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Surface things aren’t quite so simple.  Most folks would say, myself included, that a) any important data should always be backed up b) with the prevalence of online storage surely anything really important would be in OneDrive or Dropbox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed - when calling Surface support the technician even specifically referenced OneDrive.  Although I have to say its almost like saying you can’t trust the local storage which I don’t think is a fair burden to put on the owner of something Microsoft wants to compete with Ultrabooks.  Anyway, I was mainly calling Microsoft to find out what our out of warranty options were - there is only one, pay $300 for a replacement unit.  Microsoft will not make any attempt to recover data from the dead Surface.  This is also typical, if you send your PC back to Dell or HP the hard drive gets wiped, or is given to the NSA, or perhaps fed to the troll responsible for trying to make PC notebooks look like a Macbook.  So I can’t really fault Microsoft for not offering data recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except… this left us with the option I figured on from the start, cracking open the dead tablet like a delicious coconut.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+Teardown/12842&quot;&gt;iFixit rates&lt;/a&gt; the Surface Pro with its least “repairable” rating - 1/10.  Apparently we were lucky to be dealing with the first gen, its only gotten worse with more recent models.  There are no screws holding the unit together, save two that attach the kickstand.  Instead what I can only describe as black tar made by the Devil himself attaches the screen to the chassis of the tablet.  I told our client that this unit was done, there was no way I wasn’t going to destroy the thing taking it apart.  After a short treatment with the heatgun I could sort of pry up the screen.  I decided to be as brutal as I needed to be with the screen to avoid too much heatgun action damaging the drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally with the screen removed, and only a few cuts from the microscopic glass shards produced, we set to work on the interior.  The mSATA drive is on the reverse of the motherboard which is secured to the tablet with dozens and dozens of torx screws.  Very, very small torx screws I came to find out.  The Surface Pro uses T2 and T3 torx screws, some of the smallest out there and so small that my trusty Torx set didn’t include them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s where I am, with half a dead tablet.  Waiting on a 40 dollar Torx set (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CSWY50O/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;only one I could&lt;/a&gt; find with T2 and T3 heads on Amazon).  And a mSATA adapter.  Because of course the drive is mSATA.  ;)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HP EliteBook Support is really harshing our buzz</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated 3/6/2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CBP0023570_large.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;A twisting maze&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Midway upon the journey of our life,
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straight forward pathway had been lost.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite title=&quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;&gt;Dante Alighieri&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP’s EliteBook line of notebooks are intended to be the top tier of business hardware.  They automatically include a three year warranty, cost a good amount more than your average Best Buy shovelware system, and actually look and run like a computer you’d want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons we typically sell EliteBooks to all of our clients.  They may make noise about their budget but we always remind them that you get what you pay for.  If you spend five hundred bucks on a notebook it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be made of Happy Meal plastic and it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; fall apart in the middle of your super important  presentation.  Your customer will laugh at you, you will lose the sale, everything will be horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately however we’ve had some… issues with EliteBook support.  On practically all of these systems we purchase an extended warranty from HP.  On top of the better than average warranty they ship with.  This affords next business day onsite repair of hardware issues, avoiding sending the system back to HP for repairs which can take a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how one recent incident went down, dutifully documented by my diligent co-worker.  Our client had a faulty track pad…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/14 - Worked through troubleshooting steps outlined by HP, they determined that there was a hardware issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/15 - Scheduled a call for the 17th, 12-2 PM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/17 - No call, no show.  HP claims that someone tried to reach out but there’s no record in our phone system of a call.  HP now advises that parts are on back order.  Request replacement PC to get our client going ASAP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/20 - HP denies replacement request, no ETA on back ordered parts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/22 - HP still waiting on parts, expects shipment by 1/28&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/28 - No updates from HP.  Receive notice from our data center, in another time zone, that a package arrived from HP.  This was a part intended for our client.  Call HP, told that representative will call us back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/29 - No call back.  Email HP to advise on miss-shipped part.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/30 - Client receives correct part, call HP and setup appointment for 1/31 no later than 1 PM (client is traveling)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/31 - Client is contacted at 1:45 PM and told technician will be onsite at 1:55.   Client delays travel until 2:40 PM.  Technician advises that additional parts are needed to complete repair.  Repairs will now have to be delayed until 2/6 as client is traveling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2/4 - Call HP to check in, told that they are waiting on the part which the client  already has.  Explain that the client already has the part.  Call forwarded to “Barrister” team to identify which part was actually needed (no idea why HP didn’t handle this internally).  Call drops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2/5 - Call HP and request system to be replaced.  Told that the case will be reviewed and we’ll receive notice in a few days of their decision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2/10 - After no contact from HP we called back.  Told decision was delayed due to pending parts order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This continues on for a little while before HP finally relents and agrees to give us a new computer (still waiting on that).  It is now a month and a half since the case was opened.  Throughout this process we worked with about a dozen different people at HP and at least two of HP’s contractors.  Our client continues to receive parts that he already has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another client has a broken screen.  HP scheduled an appointment, went onsite, fixed the screen and closed the case.   Actually, no, the technician just reported going onsite and repairing the system, twice, without anyone showing up or doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally we have a client whose system was showing an odd error during POST after a BIOS update.  HP tells us a technician just needs to come out and use a software tool to “rebrand” the motherboard and all will be right.  The technician comes out, I verify this actually happens with my own eyeballs.  I leave and he does his thing.  I come check out the system.  Looks great!  Except the client tells me later the technician had the entire system in pieces and now the SIM card for the internal Verizon broadband adapter is missing.  HP wants to know what the part number is.  In the technician’s notes he apparently replaced the hard drive of the system (which I somehow missed when I reviewed it afterwards, maybe it only &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; to boot up and into the client’s profile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
So, the next time you complain about your phone service, why don&#39;t you try using two Dixie cups with a string? We don&#39;t care. We don&#39;t have to. We&#39;re the Phone Company. 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite title=&quot;Lily Tomlin&quot;&gt;Lily Tomlin, SNL&#39;s Phone Company sketch&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a small business.  Our clients are small businesses.  We do not order hundreds of systems at a time.  We do not have a sales rep at our beck and call.  The purpose of this blog is to at least get our frustrations out there.  However pointless it may be to toss into the winds of the Internet.  Maybe someone that matters will see this?  Until then, we just ordered a batch of Dells.  Out of the frying pan and into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/Update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post got the attention of some folks at HP.  In particular we’ve been speaking to Andrew Lamb - Director, Quality &amp;amp; Customer Assurance.  The replacement system for our customer with the faulty trackpad has arrived.  Our other customer who was having the phantom tech visits has also been taken care of.  I don’t get the feeling this post greased any wheels to get those specific issues solved but will hopefully help with future issues.  We’re still working on case number three, it appears that the technician is claiming the unit did not have a SIM card installed prior to him working on it (not true, we would definitely know if this particular user couldn’t get on Verizon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main suggestions to HP were to give us one person to speak to on these type of repair cases and to definitely never have us or our customers in the position of having to work our way through HP’s internals or those of their contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I have another EliteBook Folio that is randomly losing power.  So far we’ve only had a slight delay waiting on a back ordered part.  We’ll see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of tech/gadget enthusiasts are naturally attracted to the Nest thermostat. Its not super expensive. Its advertised as something you can DIY pretty easily. It looks beautiful! I purchased one after reading about the energy saving people were able to get out of them. And mostly I have no impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first signs of trouble were when my order hadn’t shipped after 4 days (albeit I ordered on a Friday afternoon). I emailed Nest support on the morning of the fifth day and received a cryptic call from them that afternoon that I couldn’t really devote much attention to as I was neck deep in a new server for a client. But at the end of the call the phone rep told me I’d be getting an email in a few minutes showing that the Nest had shipped. I didn’t, and I called 2 hours later. After about 30 minutes on the phone I spoke to someone that explained that their ordering system had some sort of error, that they had sorted it out and that my Nest would ship the next day. And it did. So that’s one problem dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the thermostat on a Saturday. I eagerly un-boxed and got the thing on the wall. No issues and it was a snap to get setup. Thermostat wiring, at least for our system here, is pretty much a no-brainer. While stepping through the initial setup I joined our wireless network. The Nest then reported it timed out looking for updates and would try again later (first sign of trouble). I was then presented with the error “Entry Key Error: Initializing please try again” when I tried to get the code I needed to pair to my Nest account from the device. The online account is how the Nest talks to the various apps and monitoring that really make it interesting. I shrugged it off and left for the night, the thermostat itself was working fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I started down a rabbit hole of troubleshooting that killed an entire Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Nest reported that it joined my wireless - it couldn’t get online, apparently. I suspected it was my Meraki network equipment as I’ve had some issues with other “consumer” wireless clients and the Meraki. I tried changing my router/ap to a trusty Netgear WNDR3700 that I’ve had for years. Same issue. After joining the wireless - “Entry Key Error: Initializing please try again”. At this point I called Nest support and I was promptly shutdown. My Netgear was on Nest’s unsupported routers list. Yes they have a list of some &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.nest.com/article/Unsupported-Wi-Fi-Access-Points&quot;&gt;pretty common home routers&lt;/a&gt; that Nest just can’t seem to work correctly with. Never mind that I had only switched to the Netgear because my Meraki didn’t work. The support rep basically said she was sorry and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get off the line and I go into full IT guy mode. I started forwarding ports. And I turned off wireless security. I set static IPs. Blah blah blah, wireless sucks and you get used to dealing with weird issues. I even took my (horrible) Ubee modem from TWC out of bridge mode and tried to use &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; as the wireless router. None of this worked. So I called Nest support again and explained all I had been doing. I got bumped to level two and then level three. We connected the Nest to my computer via USB and manually updated it. We even got out my Karma hotspot and tried to connect the Nest to it. No dice. Btw if you’re reading this and have a Nest, if the unit reports 0ms ping it means the wireless isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So finally Nest support decides they’re going to send me a replacement unit. I received that replacement today. For the past several days the original unit has been fine as just a pretty looking thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swap should have been easy. You just pop the busted unit off the wall (it sort of just clicks into its wall mount) and then put the new unit on. The new unit immediately got stuck in a loop. It would tell you “Please remove the Nest from it’s base and then reattach it” and then “Please attach the display to the base.” Over and over and over. Back on the phone with Nest support. This time we moved wires around on the base. Turned our ac/heating units on and off a half dozen times. Reset the Nest over USB using a ResetToDefault file. All to no avail. The unit would not finish booting. It cannot be used as a thermostat. Maybe it could pass as a busted GladOS unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now waiting on a replacement for my replacement. They were at least nice enough to overnight it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kicker to all this? The original unit was working fine, just no wireless. After giving up on the replacement I put it back on the base and it immediately asked me to “Please remove the Nest from it’s base and then reattach it”. In the words of the Jonah Hill meme - Fuck me, right? I’m sort of questioning what I might have done wrong. Did I wire something incorrectly? I have our original thermostat reconnected and its working fine. I don’t know what I’m going to do now. Even if the second replacement works I’m kind of worried its going to somehow put out the pilot on our furnace and blow the house up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 8-16-2013&lt;/em&gt; 
The second replacement unit and base came in. I installed both and the Nest booted up and walked through setup without an issue. Joined the wireless with no problem and its working just fine. So two bad units in a row and nothing more? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Be careful with Windows DNS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today I was looking into an issue for a client. In an audit report for folder moves/deletes it was shown that a user (Edgar) moved a folder, but did it from a machine that wasn’t his (Hank’s PC). It turns out this is because both Edgar and Hank had connected to the client’s VPN. This VPN uses its own pool of IPs instead of the Windows DHCP server onsite. Therefore the DNS records for the VPN client’s aren’t kept up-to-date by DHCP. So Edgar and Hank were both in DNS with the same IP. This wouldn’t be an issue very often but could be confusing for the client when it does happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking of ways to resolve this I decided to increase the interval that DNS deletes stale records. By default this isn’t very frequently, about once every 3 days. In true Microsoft fashion there’s this &lt;a href=&quot;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759204%28v=ws.10%29.aspx&quot;&gt;whole complicated process&lt;/a&gt; by which the DNS server decides which records are stale enough to delete. I decided it wouldn’t be that big of a deal to delete stale records once every 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about… 3 hours and suddenly our monitoring system is losing connection to several of the client’s servers. I check DNS and sure enough about  half the servers’ records are gone. After some more digging I found out that by default Windows only re-registers itself with the local DNS server once every 24 hours. This value can be changed using the DefaultRegistrationRefreshInterval registry key (see Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/246804&quot;&gt;KB246804&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I should have checked this before making sweeping changes to the DNS configuration. But that would make me a good administrator instead of just so/so. :)&lt;/p&gt;
